# Import data from Aspen HYSYS into Excel. An Introduction

HYSYS is a powerful software for chemical processes simulation that includes rigorous data for a lot of substances and a bunch of unit operations which allows those who dares to learn how to use it obtaining information not only of:

- Equation of State solutions for pure substances and mixes,
- EVL and EVL-L for Mixes (Including K values),
- Enthalpy and Entropy calculus,
- Equilibrium Stage Separations like Absorption or Distillation,
- Heat Exchanges, and
- Reactions.

But even allows users to “customize” and use it as an independent Calc Engine or Database. However, to get this information, users must have knowledge (not so deep) on how the Automation works on Microsoft Windows and how the HYSYS objects can be access from outside itself.
